# Count Characters in Strings
[www.codewars.com/kata/count-characters-in-your-string/train/javascript](https://www.codewars.com/kata/count-characters-in-your-string/train/javascript)

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters(UTF-8) in string. If you have string like this aba then the result should be { 'a': 2, 'b': 1 }

What if the string is empty ? Then the result should be empty object literal { }

For C#: Use a Dictionary<char, int> for this kata!
