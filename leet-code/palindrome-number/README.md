[leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/discuss/5128/Python-solution-based-on-the-algorithm-in-leetcode-blog](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/discuss/5128/Python-solution-based-on-the-algorithm-in-leetcode-blog)
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:
```
Input: 121
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
